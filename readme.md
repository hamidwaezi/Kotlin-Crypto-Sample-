# CryptoList - Kotlin Android App

![CryptoList](imgs/screenshot_3.png)

CryptoList is a simple Android application that provides a clean, user-friendly interface to browse
a list of cryptocurrencies with basic details for each. This app is built using **Kotlin** and
follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, allowing for scalable, testable, and maintainable
code. It's designed with the future in mind as I expand my skills in Android development.

## Features

- Browse a list of popular cryptocurrencies.
- View detailed information for each cryptocurrency.
- Clean, intuitive user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The primary language for development.
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns and easier testing/maintenance.
- **Coroutines**: For managing asynchronous tasks.
- **Ktor**: To fetch data from cryptocurrency APIs.
- **Adaptive Navigation**: For screen naviation.
- **Koin**: For dependency injection.
- **Jetpack Compose**: ...

## Motivation

I created CryptoList as a learning project to further develop my skills in **Kotlin**, **Clean
Architecture**, and Android best practices. My aim is to create a modular, maintainable,
implementing industry-standard tools and techniques.
